What is WebdriverIO?
WebdriverIO is an open source e2e (End-to-End) test automation utility for nodejs. It lets you control a browser or a mobile application with just a few lines of code. It makes it possible to write super easy selenium tests with Javascript in your favorite BDD or TDD test framework.

It basically sends requests to a Selenium server via the WebDriver Protocol and handles its response. These requests are wrapped in useful commands and can be used to test several aspects of your site in an automated way.

Run:
Please install 16.x Node.js

*npm i

*npm run wdio
